* 🐝 I’m currently a student at [hive.fi](https://www.hive.fi/en/), a school belonging to the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/network-42/).
* 🆎 I’ve been writing plenty of **C** code for the last year or so.
* 🐚 I know my way around **Unix/Linux** systems; proficient at the **command-line** and **shell-scripting**.
* 🌱 At the moment I’m polishing my knowledge about **Web Tecnologies**.
* 🔎 Always willing to **learn** new stuff. Things that interest me: math, cryptography, cybersecurity, new languages, competitive programming...
* 👯 I’m looking for a **job**, remote or in-site (open to change my location).
